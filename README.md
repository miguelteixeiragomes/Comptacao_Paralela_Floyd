# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

In computer science, the Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths 
in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles)

# Implementation

This code was developed with the intent of solving the Floyd-Warshall alrogithm
in a multi-computer cluster. The algorithm itself is implemented in C and 
paralelized with OpenMPI. This code also includes some python scripts
for launching the code on a given cluster, analysing data such as computation time
and random matrix creation.

The matrix multiplication inherent to the algorithm is solved using the Fox
algorithm with a small tweak to improve effiency since the calculations 
involved in the F-W algorithm can be mathematically simplified beforehand.

# Compiling and executing

A makefile is included in this repo.

After compiling, the output program takes as external arguments
a file where the first line corresponds to the dimension N of the
square matrix and the subsequent lines contain the lines of the matrix.
The line elements are separated by spaces (' ')
